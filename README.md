# Data Cleaning using SQL

## Outline of Data Cleaning Project

This short analysis project cleans housing addresses data by using SQL.

Removed time from datetime format, so that only date is kept.

Replaced null values with appropriate values.

Splitted property address to street address, city, state, and zip code.

Changed similar responses into single common response.
