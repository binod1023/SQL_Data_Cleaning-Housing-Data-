This short analysis project cleans housing addresses data by using SQL server.
Formated data in standard formate and structure: street, city, state, and zip code.
Bought uniformity in spelling and abbreviation  on the common names in the housing address.
Removed time from datetime format, so that only date is kept.
Changed similar responses into single common response.
