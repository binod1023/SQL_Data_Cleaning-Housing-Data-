# Data Cleaning using SQL
## Overview of the Project
This short analysis project cleans housing addresses data by using SQL server. 

## Prerequisit  
SQL server is used  

The dataset for this project is used from the national housing data from Nasville, Tennesse.

## Outline of Data Cleaning Project
The extracted data are not in the standard format, so the housing address are formated in standard formate and structure: street, city, state, and zip code.  
Bought uniformity in spelling and abbreviation  on the common names in the housing address.  
Removed time from datetime format, so that only date is kept.
People have given different responses for the same response, so similar responses are changed into single common response.
